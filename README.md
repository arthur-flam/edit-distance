# Edit distance

Short code to compute edit distances.

- Since we keep the whole score matrix in memory we should a least add the option to backtrace the aligmnment. Or keep two rows only.
- Initialization could be set apart, this would ease the syntax.

## Setup

```bash
pip install green
```

## Test

```bash
green
```
